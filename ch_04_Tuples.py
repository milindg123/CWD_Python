# Tuple -> Tuple is immutable -> cannot Changed element    # we cannot not altered or manipulated the tuple
# List  -> List are mutable   -> Can change element


# Creating a tuple using ()

t = (1,2,3,4,5)
# t1 = ()       # Empty Tuple
# t1 = (1)        # Wrong way to declare a tuple with single element
t1 = (1,)       # Tuple with single element
print(t1)

# Printing the elements of a tuple

# print(t[0])

# Cannot upadate the tuple
# t[0] = 34
# print(t)     # Throws an error
